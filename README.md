# Sorting-Visualizer

## Overview

The Dynamic Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. This project is designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work and observe their real-time performance on a dynamic set of data. Additionally, it includes separate web pages for analyzing the Space and Time complexity of these sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Visual representation of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Dynamic visualization that allows users to interactively see the sorting process on randomly generated data sets.
- Adjustable speed controls for visualizing sorting algorithms at different speeds.
- Separate web pages for analyzing the Space and Time complexity of sorting algorithms.
- User-friendly interface for an intuitive experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Janhavi0528/dynamic-sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd Sorting-Visualizer
    ```

3. Open the `Welcome.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

-On choosing Sorting Visualizer:
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Adjust the speed slider to control the visualization speed.
4. Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new set of data.
5. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization of the selected algorithm.

-On choosing Complexity of Algorithm:
Explore the space complexity analysis of sorting algorithms.
